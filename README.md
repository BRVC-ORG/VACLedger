# VACLedger

> Exploratory on-chain registry for Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) metadata and ban transparency.

VACLedger is an experimental project that explores how **VAC-related metadata** (not cheat code, not bypasses) could be mirrored or referenced **on-chain** to improve:

- Transparency  
- Auditability  
- Long-term integrity of anti-cheat records  

The goal is **not** to undermine or evade VAC, but to prototype a system where:

- Ban events or hashed identifiers can be **recorded immutably**
- Third-party tournament platforms or community servers can **verify ban status** trustlessly
- Researchers can explore **privacy-preserving, cryptographically verifiable** anti-cheat registries
