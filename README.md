VACLedger is an experimental project that explores how VAC-related metadata could be mirrored or referenced on-chain to improve transparency, auditability, and long-term integrity of anti-cheat records.

The goal is not to undermine or evade VAC, but to prototype a system where:

Ban events or hashed identifiers can be recorded immutably

Third-party tournament platforms or community servers can verify ban status trustlessly

Researchers can explore privacy-preserving, cryptographically verifiable anti-cheat registries

This repo contains smart-contract prototypes, data schemas, and simulations — no cheat tools, no bypasses, no reverse-engineering of VAC itself.
