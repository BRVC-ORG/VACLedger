# VACLedger

> Exploratory on-chain registry for Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) metadata and ban transparency.

VACLedger is an experimental project that explores how **VAC-related metadata** could be mirrored or referenced **on-chain** to improve:

- Transparency  
- Auditability  
- Long-term integrity of anti-cheat records
